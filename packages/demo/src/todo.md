# To Do

1. Ressurect smart filter with frame, blur, and video
1. Save editor metadata
1. Save button in editor for JSON
1. BUG: use texture input, change, create new texture input, use it - new one is disposed
1. Add serializers/deserializers for all demo blocks
1. Move shader code out into .glsl files
    - Look up run-p approach used in Babylon.js repo
    - .ts files are .gitignored
    - Trick: no extension in the import statement
1. Move into another project out of the repo (need to publish editor)
